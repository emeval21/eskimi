**Task description**:

Using the Laravel framework you will need to create a simple application for managing advertising campaigns. 

**Advertising campaign consists of fields**:

1. Name - string format.
2. Dates (`from` and `to`) - date format.
3. Total budget (in USD) - float format (2 decimal places).
4. Daily budget (in USD) - float format (2 decimal places).
5. Creative upload - multiple banner images of any size can be added. - image file upload.

**User should be able to**:

1. create and edit an advertising campaign;
2. see all created advertising campaigns: name, date, daily budget, total budget, and a creative preview button on a single web page;
3. creative preview button should show advertising campaignâ€™s uploaded creatives in a popup (same page);
4. navigate from campaign create/edit to campaign listing page and the other way around.

**Technical requirements**
Two API endpoints should be created:
1. Endpoint for submitting a new advertising campaign.
2. Endpoint for listing the advertising campaigns and their info.
3. 
For the creative preview button, create a reusable Vue.js component. No need to alter any CSS files or spend time making the user interface look really nice.
